## 🔬 Research Focus & Publications

* **[Lost-in-the-Middle in Industrial Contexts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13900)** * Evaluated 7-8B SOTA models on the **GM-Extract** benchmark.
    * Investigated spatial retrieval failures and "middle-context" performance drops.
* **[Auto-formalization for LLM Verification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11829)** * Framework for translating LLM reasoning into formal specifications.
    * Achieving "closed-loop" verification against ground truth data.
* **[Implicit Knowledge for Hierarchical RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10806)** * Developed a novel method for retrieving tree-structured data in vector databases.
    * Improved efficiency for complex engineering documentation.

## 💼 Work & Open Source Policy

Most of my codebase is developed within **private enterprise environments** (including work with engineering teams at General Motors). 

* **Note on Public Repos:** My GitHub activity does not reflect my daily output, as the majority of my work involves proprietary industrial work.
* **Open Research:** While the core implementation code is private, I am committed to publishing the **methodologies, benchmarks (like GM-Extract), and theoretical findings** via ArXiv and research conferences.
